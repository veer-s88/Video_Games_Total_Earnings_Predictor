# Video_Games_Total_Earnings_Predictor
This is a machine learning/ deep learning project using neural networks, using features of video games to predict the gross total earnings of the video game

This is a very basic deep learning project and acts as a fundamentals project to create deep learning models using neural networks. Data was loaded, normalized using a MinMaxScaler with scikit-learn, a simple model was created with the final layer using a linear activation function and a prediction was made on an unseen video game

The notebook for this project can be seen in Video_Game_Earnings_Predictor.ipynb, the training and test data is seen in the csv files and the csv file of features for a random video game to make a prediction is also seen in this repository.
